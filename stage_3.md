## Introduction

Now that the user has a dungeon that they can move around, we need to make it interesting. At this stage we will populate our dungeon with characters that the user can interact with.

To achieve this we will:

1. Define a character class
2. Create characters
3. Add characters to the rooms
4. Include characters in the room descriptions
5. Create character interactions
   - talk method
   - hug method
   - fight method
6. Add interactions to the main loop

### Class Diagram

The `Character` class is a new class, so it will require a second class diagram.

We also need to add a `character` attribute to the `Room` class so we can record who is in each room.

## Define the Character class

In Thonny create a new file and enter the code below. Then save it as **character.py** in the same folder as **main.py** and **room.py** (remember capitalisation).

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 1, 3, 5-9
# character.py

class Character():
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        # initialises the character object
        self.name = name
        self.description = None
        self.conversation = None
```

Let's investigate this code:

- `# character.py` &rarr; comment to identify the file we are working in
- `class Character():` &rarr; defining our new class called `Character`
- `def __init__(self, name):` &rarr; the dunder init method that is run whenever a `Character` object is created.
- `# initialises the character object` &rarr; explains the purpose of the method
- `self.name = name` &rarr; assigned the value passed in the `name` argument to this `Character` object's `name` attribute.
- `self.description = None` &rarr; creates a `description` attribute for the `Character` object
- `self.conversation = None` &rarr; creates a `converstaion` attribute for the `Character` object

## Create characters

Now that we have a `Character` class, we can go to **main.py** and create `Character` objects.

Open **main.py** and add the highlighted code below.

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 4, 22-24, 26-28
# main

from room import Room
from character import Character

# create rooms
cavern = Room("Cavern")
cavern.description = ("A room so big that the light of your torch doesnâ€™t reach the walls.")

armoury = Room("Armoury")
armoury.description = ("The walls are lined with racks that once held weapons and armour.")

lab = Room("Laboratory")
lab.description = ("A strange odour hangs in a room filled with unknownable contraptions.")

# link rooms
cavern.link_rooms(armoury,"south")
armoury.link_rooms(cavern,"north")
armoury.link_rooms(lab,"east")
lab.link_rooms(armoury,"west")

# create characters
ugine = Character("Ugine")
ugine.description = "a huge troll with rotting teeth."

nigel = Character("Nigel")
nigel.description = "a burly dwarf with golden bead in woven through his beard."
nigel.conversation = "Well youngan, what are you doing here?"

'''
# describe the rooms
cavern.describe()
armoury.describe()
lab.describe()
'''
```

Investigating that code:

- `from character import Character` &rarr; get our `Character` class from the **character.py** file
- `# create characters` &rarr; code structure comment
- `ugine = Character("Ugine")` &rarr; creates a `Character` object with the name `Ugine` and assigns it to `ugine`
- `ugine.description = "a huge troll with rotting teeth."` &rarr; changes the `ugine` `description` attribute to `"a huge troll with rotting teeth."`
- `nigel = Character("Nigel")` &rarr; creates a `Character` object with the name `Nigel` and assigns it to `nigel`
- `nigel.description = "a burly dwarf with golden bead in woven through his beard."` &rarr; changes the `nigel` `description` attribute to `"a burly dwarf with golden bead in woven through his beard."`
- `nigel.conversation = "Well youngan, what are you doing here?"` &rarr; changes the `nigel` `conversation` attribute to `"Well youngan, what are you doing here?"`
- Note that we didn't change the `conversation` attribute for `ugine`. This means it will reamin with the default value of `None`
