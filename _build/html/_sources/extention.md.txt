# Extensions Ideas

Now that you have finished Deepest Dungeon, it's time to start making it yours but extending it. Below are some suggestions for extra features you could add to your dungeon.

## The Dungeon

There are heaps of different ways you can extend your dungeon:

- add additional rooms
- add more directions to travel (eg. up or down)
- add rooms with locked doors

## The Characters

You can add extra features to the characters:

- have more than one conversation script (try randomly choosing from a list of conversations)
- make extra character types (there are more than just friend and enemies)


## The fight

At the moment the fight is very swift. You could make it more interesting by:

- have player and enemy health that gets lowered whilst fighting
- have different items cause different damage

## The player

The player hasn't got much detail, so you could easily add more to them:

- give the player money so they can by items
- allow for equipping of weapons or armour

## The UI

Text-based games can look quite plain. There are some tools that you use to make the terminal looks more exciting.

Be warned that these options are challenging.
