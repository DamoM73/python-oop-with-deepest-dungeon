# Deepest Dungeon - Python OOP

This site guides students through the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python by building a simple text-based adventure game. Each section breaks down key concepts into clear, manageable steps, using practical examples from the game to show how classes, objects, methods, and interactions fit together. 

The aim is to help learners understand how OOP structures real programs while giving them the confidence to expand and customise the dungeon as their skills grow.
