# Introduction for Students

In this project, you’ll build your own text-adventure game step by step. As you create rooms, characters, and items, you’ll start using a way of coding called object-oriented programming (OOP). You don’t need to know what that means yet — you’ll learn it by doing. 

Each part of the game teaches you a new idea, shows you how it works in code, and lets you test it straight away. By the end, you’ll understand how bigger programs are organised and you’ll be able to expand the dungeon using your own ideas.

## Getting Set up

### Thonny

We will be using Python as our coding langauge. To write that code we will be using a program called Thonny. You can download and install it from the [Thonny website](https://thonny.org/).

### Create a project folder

For these tutorials, it is important that all files are saved in the same folder. Therefore, you need to make a new folder just for this project.

1. Go to your subject folder
2. Create a new folder called **Deepest Dungeon**

## Understanding these tutorials

### What do the coloured boxes mean?

Throughout this site some text is enclosed in coloured boxes called callouts. These callouts have different meanings, as shown below.

```{topic} Learning Intentions
These callouts appears at the top of each page and explains what you will learn on that page.
```

```{admonition} Pseudocode
:class: pseudocode
These callouts provide the planning pseudocode for the tutorial
```

```{admonition} Code Explaination
These callouts appear after a code block. In these callout each new line is explained in detail.
```

```{admonition} Concept Explainations
:class: note
These callouts explains a new concpet that had been referred to. They helps you understand some of the techinical words we will use.
```

```{admonition} Warnings
:class: warning
These callouts appear when you need to be very careful about something.
```

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5
"""
Blocks like these contain code.
It is formatted to identify Python syntax.
Each line of code is numbered.
When the text refers to highlighted code, look for lines like this. 
When copying the code, ensure the indentations are accurate.
"""
```

### Different text formatting

Throughout this site, the formatting has the following meaning:
* `text inside greyed boxes` &rarr; this is code text. 
* ***bold and italicised text*** &rarr; these are file names and folders.
* **bold text** &rarr; important concepts.
